defmodule BB.Policy do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for learned policies that map observations to actions.

  A *policy* is a function `π: observation → action`. Given what the robot
  perceives (joint positions, velocities, camera frames, force readings), the
  policy produces what it should do (target positions, velocities, gripper
  commands). Rather than programming every motion explicitly, operators train
  policies from demonstrations or simulation and deploy them on real hardware
  with full safety-system integration.

  Policies are *stateful*. Some architectures (RNNs, transformers with context,
  and action-chunking models such as ACT) carry hidden state or a queue of
  pending actions across timesteps. This behaviour threads an opaque `state/0`
  through every callback so implementations own their own lifecycle.

  ## Lifecycle

  `c:init/1` is called once when the policy loads. Then, on every control tick,
  `BB.Policy.Runner` drives this cycle:

      observe/3  →  act/2  →  action_to_commands/3

  `c:reset/1` is called at episode boundaries to clear accumulated state.

  ## Implementing a policy

      defmodule MyRobot.Policy.PickMug do
        @behaviour BB.Policy

        @impl BB.Policy
        def init(opts), do: {:ok, %{model: load(opts[:model])}}

        @impl BB.Policy
        def reset(state), do: %{state | hidden: nil}

        # ...observe/3, act/2, action_to_commands/3
      end

  See `BB.Policy.ONNX` for the recommended implementation that loads models
  trained in Python (LeRobot, PyTorch, JAX) and exported to ONNX.
